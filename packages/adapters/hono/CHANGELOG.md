# @kavachos/hono

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 94804ec: Launch wave B: explicit major alignment for adapters/plugins after core moves to the 0.1 line.

  Why major:

  - These packages are pre-1.0 and depend on core package version semantics.
  - Core 0.0.x -> 0.1.x is treated as breaking for dependent package versioning.

  Operator notes:

  - Publish this wave separately from the core/client 0.1.0 wave.
  - Keep `@kavachos/dashboard` on its independent track.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [94804ec]
  - kavachos@0.1.0
